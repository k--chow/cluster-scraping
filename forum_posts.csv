Patient Registry,General Board,Patient Registry,"August 16, 2014","Hello everyone!!

Have you registered on the Clusterbusters Â“Patient RegistryÂ” yet?

Over the years, Clusterbusters has built the largest worldwide patient database in the world. Become a member of the database and possibly a participant in a research project that will lead to better treatments and eventually a part of the cure.

By completing this form, you are not registering for a specific study that is underway or that will start in the future. You are not agreeing to become a participant in anything. You are only agreeing to the possibility of being contacted in the future to ask for your participation.

Research studies sometimes only require your participation from home. It may only require completing surveys or questionnaires. Some of you may have recently done this for the work underway at Yale University. Some clinical studies require your participation in other ways. Some may include travel. Each study has different requirements. Choice of participation is yours and that of the study investigators and does not involve Clusterbusters in any part of the process.

This registry is open for everyone. There are no requirements of past, present or future choice of treatments or any particular cluster headache or human traits.

People from all walks of life, all ages and every description, suffer from cluster headaches.

We are presently involved in several ongoing research projects as well as several others that are in the long process of approval.

As we are involved in research on an international basis, this survey is open to everyone worldwide. We encourage anyone with cluster headaches to respond and help inform others of its existence. As many studies focus on certain segments of the cluster population, episodics vs. chronics as an example, you may not be contacted for every study that is underway.

Be a part of a better future for cluster headache patients and participate in our registry.

As you will see again on the forms themselves, all of this information is and will remain completely private. The survey, all data and any and all future distribution is administered by the ClusterbusterÂ’s Administrative panel and members of its medical advisory board. 

Information and people will move the research forward. Please be a part of this. Just the completion of the questions on this short survey, by the thousands that are included, helps gather important information.

Please share this with others you may know that suffer from clusters. If you know of anyone that does not have access to a computer, contact us at info@clusterbusters.org and we will mail a written copy for completion and inclusion.

To participate, please go to this link:

Some of the questions may give you an idea of some of the projects we are currently working on and there will also be more information available at this years conference.

Even if you can't make the conference, we'd love to have everyone here on the registry.

Thank you

Bob Wold

Clusterbusters

Headache Treatment Protocol Update,General Board,Headache Treatment Protocol Update,"October 2, 2023","I've finally completed the update to the Anti-Inflammatory Regimen - Cluster and Migraine Headache Treatment Protocol.  I've titled the update ""Quick Start Guide"" as it streamlines the process of starting this treatment protocol. 


Henry Lahore, founder of VitaminDWiki.com, was kind enough to publish the Quick Start Guide on VitaminDWiki. This VitaminDWiki web page is titled: 


Cluster and Migraine headache treatment protocol - Sept 2023 


Short URL = https://is.gd/cluster2023 


The download link for CHers and Migraineurs who want a pdf copy they can send to others =  


http://vitamindwiki.com/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=20148&page=Cluster and Migraine headache treatment protocol - Sept 2023&download=y 


You can also download a copy by going to the Attached Files section of this web page and click on the following link: 


Quick Start Guide - Sept 2023.pdf 


The goals of this update include an improved response rate among CHers, Migraineurs and a surprising number of CHers who also suffer from migraine headaches.  To meet these goals, this update now includes provisions for two or more vitamin D3 loading schedules with higher vitamin D3 maintenance doses and higher 25(OH)D3 serum concentrations.  (Note, multiple loading schedules should be done under a physician's supervision with assays for serum 25(OH)D3, calcium and PTH following each loading schedule to ensure calcium and PTH remain within their normal reference ranges).  


The following chart illustrates this can be accomplished safely without driving serum calcium or PTH out of their respective normal reference ranges.  As you can see from this graphic, serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations are a very poor indication of vitamin D3 toxicity. 


 


This update also includes a collection of supplements I call the Antihistamine Full Monty as there are a lot of them and these supplements have antihistamine properties.  Many of these supplements are also frequently found in migraine treatments.  


Once you've followed the Quick Start Guide for at least 30 days, please feel free to comment in this thread and do take the listed survey. 


Take care, 


V/R, Batch, a.k.a. XXX

Great News Gang!!!,General Board,Great News Gang!!!,"July 19, 2022","You see those nice Medical O2 tanks on my deck?  


THEY WERE FREE!!!!!


	Yes. I saw my Neuro last week and requested a script for O2. He gladly obliged and WE filled out a form. Our local O2 carrier is Lincare. The form has a bunch of questions unrelated to Clusters, so we left those blank. There were a lot of blanks! 

	It stated ' minimum of 15LPM with a non-rebreather mask for 15 minutes, as needed for Cluster Headache'.


	My delivery came in 24 hours!! They will bring however much I require every week. 'How long does one tank last for you? How many next week?'


	So, should you need it and you are on Medicare, you can now receive it!! I am in heaven. Also in cycle, but this project makes it SOOOO worth the pain. I am delighted to have this cycle and uncover this stupid mystery we have been wondering about.


	Thanks to all of those who were able to attend 'Headache on the Hill'!!! WE WON!! 


	Ok, time for a massive HAPPY DANCE. 

	Yes, I will Pin this!

Birth control and cluster headaches,General Board,Birth control and cluster headaches,"August 21, 2021","Has anyone had any success is controlling clust headaches with low hormonal bc?


	I was recently trying to get pregnant and have PCOS. The crazy hormone meds they gave me triggered a CH cycle and now nothing is helping break this cycle. I have also noticed some symptoms to tell me my hormones are still out of whack.


	Do you think it's worth trying bc pills to balance that out? (I have given up on the idea of have children).
